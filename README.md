# About
A page to host my resume. ðŸ“š Ultimately to link on applications, linkedin, etc. 

The idea behind this modular format: Separation of concerns, making it easier to add content, iterate on content, and hopefully simpler to style.

```

`resume.html` is created by running `ruby render.rb` at the root of the project. 

Each component of the resume is a partial, included in `resume.erb` that is rendered in the creation of `resume.html`.

(Do not make updates directly to `resume.html`).

## Styling

Future plans include adding CSS for styling. Currently, the focus is on the content structure.
